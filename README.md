## Let’s Celebrate Foundation

# About Us 
Let’s celebrate is a registered non – profit that works to bring social and emotional learning (SEL) in the poverty-stricken and underprivileged strata of the society to enable them to celebrate their life. WE believe that everyone deserves their share of joy and happiness by exercising their right to celebrate and this can be achieved by uplifting the emotional intelligence of our society.
Our approach includes youth participation from schools and other institutes to create a memorable and a special day for someone or a community in need. We treat them as our celebrity on that day and celebrate them for who they are. Our programs connect students to the underprivileged communities, to encourage them to be socially responsible and move towards building an inclusive society.

# Mission 
Our mission is to promote social and emotional learning to bring celebration into the lives of the marginalized members of our society for their psychosocial well being.

# Vision 
Our vision is to inculcate the spirit of emotional intelligence to improve the mental and emotional health of the people. By bringing people from different strata’s to celebrate together, we aim to foster better understandings, bond and leadership qualities to build a respectful, helpful and an inclusive society.

# Social and Emotional Learning 
(Use the design that we have made for the Brochure)
Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is a process through which one learns to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships and make responsible decisions.

# PROGRAMS –

# Challenge Day India
* Challenge Day is a highly acclaimed SEL program in the US which is transforming the lives of the students from the last thirty years, not just in the US but all over the world. Fortunately, they have now come to India with their signature program to give a life-changing experiential learning to the students in India.
* The education system in India is majorly academics oriented and focus is on the child’s grade performance rather than identifying the child learning capabilities and addressing the needs of the child’s innate skills. Adding to this, is the pressure of exams and the demands of meeting the expectations of parents and society on the children that makes them vulnerable to stress, anxiety, isolation, behavior issues, depression and other such disorders.
* Challenge Day India program goes beyond traditional anti-bullying efforts, building empathy and inspiring a school-wide movement of compassion and positive change. The program aims to bring social and emotional learning in schools in India as an important component for the holistic development of youth to make them happier, more compassionate and responsible citizens of the world.
## Creatively showcase 
* 12 Challenge Days so far
* More than 1000 + students impacted
